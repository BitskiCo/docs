# Sales Details

At the bottom of our product menu, we allow creators to choose their sales type. We offer three types of sales types: auctions, limited editions \(aka fixed price listings\) & open editions

## Auctions

You can place your minimum bids accordingly as well as a start time and the duration of how long youâ€™d like your auction to run. If an auction is already live, and if for any reason you want to edit the auction, we highly recommend to not pause the item as it will restart the auction timer when you re-publish it.

If you need to edit an auction, we recommend that you adjust the necessary areas and then simply hit save.

## Limited Editions \(aka fixed price listings\)

For limited editions, choose your quantity and set a price. This type of sales is quantity based so will run for an infinite amount of time until all quantities are sold.

## Open Edition

These are timed sales and this is a functionality we will offer on the UI soon! At this current time, it is a manual process so the amount of open editions we can manually handle for folks is limited. But if you're still keen on getting this set up, please email us at support@bitski.com with the following information:
