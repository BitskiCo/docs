# FAQ

Here are some answers to the questions we get asked most often.

## What networks do you support?

Bitski currently supports mainnet and the Kovan and Rinkeby test networks. To request support for your Ethereum compatible network, please [contact us](mailto:support@bitski.com).

## How much does Bitski charge?

Bitski is currently free of charge for users, developers can see our [pricing page](https://www.bitski.com/pricing/) for more information.

## What are the benefits of Bitski managing key storage for new users?

Secure key storage is very challenging, and a siloed approach will be inconvenient for your users. Users will have to fund this wallet separately, and can only manage their assets through your interface.

## How should I integrate Bitski in my app?

A great place to start is to put our [sign in button](https://github.com/bitskico/bitski-js#using-the-bitski-connect-button) wherever you're currently asking people to install Metamask.

## I already have an app that uses Metamask, can I use Bitski?

The Bitski SDK is designed to be compatible with other wallets and dapp browsers, while providing a great experience for users who don't already have a wallet. Learn more about integrating our JS SDK [here](https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js).

## How are you storing and managing private keys?

Our keys are both created and stored on our HSMs \(Hardware Security Module\). Approved transactions are passed to the HSM to sign. The keys never leave the hardware.

## Do you have an Android SDK?

Not at the moment, but that is on our roadmap.

## How will users fund their wallet?

Currently for ETH, users can sign into our [web wallet](https://wallet.bitski.com) and click **Get ETH** to purchase via credit card.

However, if you're working with digital assets, we suggest using a backend with App Wallet to send assets to users directly. This prevents the need for the user to purchase ETH, while allowing them to have decentralized ownership.
