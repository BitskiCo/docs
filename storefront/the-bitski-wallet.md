# The Bitski Wallet

### More than a NFT Marketplace

In 2018, we started with the Bitski wallet before evolving into a NFT marketplace. This helped us power our platform in more ways than one giving a chance for all individuals and companies to interact with the published NFTs on our market. 

To begin with, our Bitski wallet offers buyers and collectors ways to store their NFT. Post-transaction, the NFT will appear in the Bitski wallet with a thumbnail.

### Cross-Platform

Our Bitski wallet is single-sign on meaning you can connect the wallet to platforms able to support us. Instead of having to download multiple wallets, we make that easier for you.

The wallet can additionally be used to resell your NFTs on secondary marketplaces, like OpenSea for example. We take the worries of understanding blockchain and all those technicalities for our customers.

### Compatibility

We are superior to most other wallets as we support:

* Storage for NFTs
* ERC20 tokens
* ERC-721 collectible items
