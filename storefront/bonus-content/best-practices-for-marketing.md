# Best Practices for Marketing

## Announce Your NFT

We always end up forgetting the power we hold in our phones but remember that there are about 7 billion people in the world and more than half of them are online. Let's take advantage of it 📲

### 🤳 Social

* Add an Instagram Story / Grid / Reel / TV \(tag us @bitskibitski\)
  * Paid Social: Consider setting up a paid social campaign for your Instagram Story / Grid to make sure your audience sees the post \(note: less than 10% of your audience normally sees organic posts\)
* Twitter Tweet / Fleet \(tag us @bitski\)
  * Paid Social: Consider setting up a paid social campaign for your Tweet to make sure your audience sees the post \(note: less than 10% of your audience normally sees organic posts\)
* Join our Discord community server and share a link: [https://discord.gg/v5VZ9HxCr9](https://discord.gg/v5VZ9HxCr9)

Consider new channels like TikTok but we recommend engaging with the platform you have the most engagement on.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Friends in High Places

* Tag your more influential friends in your social posts and ask \(nicely\) for a repost

## Extra Credit

#### 🎉 Promote Often

Given the unpredictable nature of social media algorithms, it's best to promote often and not rely on one announcement post to do the work. The more often you promote, the higher the likelihood that your community will be aware of the sale and more likely to purchase.

#### 💌 Be Meaningful

 The success of an NFT drop isn't about the size of your audience, but how engaged they are. Fans are more likely to participate and purchase if they see you meaningfully promoting your NFTs \(i.e. behind-the-scenes documentation, IGTV interviews, QVC-inspired stream, etc.\). Be sure to highlight what is special and unique about the NFT drop \(i.e. is it driving awareness and/or funds for a timely social issue? Is there special unlockable content? etc.\)

#### 📢 Include Call-to-Actions

With every piece of communication that goes out, make sure there's a clear call-to-action such as going to the Bitski page or signing up for an email reminder to increase the chances of your audience taking an action that will ultimately lead to a sale.
