# 4-Part Creator Portal

## Products

This is where you can begin scheduling and drafting your NFTs. Here you can add your title, product description, any unlockable content, snap lens and even instagram filters. 

Want something more to add? You could even drop a .mp3! 

This section is also where you get to specify your sales details such as limited edition quantiy, the price point, auction hours and more. 

## Activity

With every transaction made for the creator's NFT, it will be logged in the activity section of the portal. 

## Collection

This is where your smart contract exists and you will see it as a "Collection" name. At this current time, we do not yet offer the UI feature for creators to click and create a new contract on their own, but we're working on it and growing as we go. 

## Settings

Creators have the opportunity to link their socials like their website portfolio, Instagram and Twitter on their custom storefront. They can also add a creator profile icon and page description as well. 

It is important to remind new creators that in the "Settings" is also where they set up their subscriptions and connect their bank accounts for payouts.

## Great job on hitting this milestone!

Now let's get to the real work ðŸ˜ˆ
