# Our Product Menu

## Title

This will be the title of your product, and will be placed underneath your NFT when published on your custom storefront

## Description <a id="85868dde-db1b-448c-9c9a-e839179cc70e"></a>

Place any product descriptions you think may be relevant to your NFT. This section can include information on any additional physical goods, utilities or experiences that buyers can unlock through the purchase.

## Properties \[Key + Value\] <a id="ebc0b8c0-6e8d-4893-9308-6f63220533af"></a>

Bitski offers a vision for gaming assets to be seen as highly valuable and creates opportunities for those in the realm of desgining gaming assets can place a value and property to their creation.

For example, the key property can be a "HP Booster" and make the value "100000" so a buyer could download then integrate that into their game. 

For those more in the abstract 2D or 3D realm, we recommend disregarding this as it will not visually appear on your product page.

## Add Media <a id="8213ec22-f27d-4a11-826b-57d0fa04d817"></a>

This space will be used to upload your primary assets\*. There is a section for an image and a video respectively.

{% hint style="info" %}
Primary assets are the thumbnails of your product that appear on the custom storefront. This is what buyers, and visitors will see on the screen.
{% endhint %}

The image will be what your buyers receive on their email receipts post-purchase and what will appear on your custom storefront, **only if there is no video or 3D files as part of the primary assets.**

If you do upload a video as part of the primary assets in addition to the primary image, it will override the image and default as the primary thumbnail on your custom storefront. 

Please make sure to note that an image is still necessary as that will be attached to email receipts.
