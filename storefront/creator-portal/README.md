# Creator Portal

## Why Bitski? 

We are a power platform that not only includes a portal to help schedule, publish, and sell your NFTs but also offer buyers or collectors opportunities to buy NFTs and store them in their Bitski wallet. We make transactions easier, more seamless to create a lower barrier of entry for everyone in the community and beyond.

## What We Offer Creators:

#### 1. 4-Part Creator Portal:

* Products
* Activity
* Collection
* Settings

#### 2. Credit Card Transactions for NFTs

Allows loyal followers and fans of the creator to be a part of the NFT community without the need to worry about cryptocurrency

#### 3. Your Own Smart Contract:

Upon registration, creators will be asked for a name. With this name, Bitski creates a smart contract in the blockchain so that every NFT resold on a secondary marketplace can always be traced back to to the creator

#### 4. Your Custom/Creator Storefront:

Creators will have sole ownership over their name and their storefront URL will be in the format of https://bitski.com/\[insert username\] 

#### 5. The 5-Min Auction Extension:

In order for buyers to avoid getting sniped, if any bid is made in the last 15 min of an auction, the time will extend an additional 5 min and the bidder will only be able to win if no other party bids against them in those 5 minutes

#### 6. Schedule NFTs Before Launch Day

We give creators the opportunity to be prepared and plan ahead. Creators schedule first, and Bitski publishes it for you

**7. 10% Royalty to Creators**

For every NFT resold on the secondary marketplace, creators receive 10% of those net sales back into their pocket. 

#### 8. Bitski Places Minting Fees to the Buyer

That's right. Our tools and model make it so that minting fees aren't placed on the creator. They are charged at the time of transaction to the buyer and we only charge minting fees to the creator for auctions.
