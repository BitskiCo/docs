In addition to managing wallets for users of your app, Bitski can also manage wallets for your backend apps and services. This is a very powerful tool, as it allows you to perform programmatic transactions on the server instead of the client, and in some cases remove the need for your users to pay gas. 

Bitski offers two kinds of programatic wallets:

## [Enterprise Wallets](app-wallet.md)

Enterprise wallets are a great place to execute transations on behalf of your organization. For instance, you could:

- Mint tokens and send them to people.
- Execute meta transactions on behalf of your users.
- Update variables in your contract.

Additionally, you can use Enterprise Wallets in Truffle for deploying your smart contracts.

## [Whitelabel Wallets](whitelabel-wallet.md)

Whitelabel wallets are a great solution when you want complete control over a users blockchain experience and your users don't need to interact with any other applications. For instance, if you want to allow users to deposit DAI and then lend that DAI out to other people.
