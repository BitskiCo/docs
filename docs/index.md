Bitski (currently in beta) lets you build *user-friendly* and *cross-platform* Ethereum apps. Using Bitski, you can build a decentralized app or game that feels just as easy to use as a standard app.

We provide you with access to the Ethereum network through our hosted nodes, and provide access to the user's wallet using OAuth. [Learn More](overview.md).
