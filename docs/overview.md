## What is Bitski

Bitski makes it much easier to build and use Ethereum apps. Users can sign up for your app without needing to install any additional software, and they can use their account from any device.

##### As a developer, you can:
- Connect to the Ethereum network through our hosted nodes
- Request access to a user's address
- Submit transactions for approval on behalf of a user
- Create and manage a wallet for your app
- Deploy contracts through your app wallet

##### As a user, you can:
- Use Ethereum apps without installing any software
- Store ethereum assets in our secure wallet
- Manage access to any apps you connect
- Recover your account at any time

## How it works

We use OAuth to provide access to a user's wallet. Through our SDK your app can request access to a users Bitski account. If permission is granted, your app can then use standard tools like web3.js to interact with the Ethereum network. Learn more in [Authentication](oauth.md).

## Why Bitski?

#### Much easier onboarding

Your users will not have to install any extra software to use your app. They can use it just like any other website or app. Once a user already has a Bitski account, they will be able to sign in with just 2 clicks!

#### Cross-platform

Since our wallets are managed in the cloud instead of tied to a specific device, you can access them from anywhere without compromising security.

#### Secured with hardware

Unlike most current wallets which are stored locally on your computer, our wallets are stored in tamper-proof hardware signing modules. The keys never leave the hardware. We believe this is far more secure.

#### Fully recoverable accounts

Since your wallet is tied to your user account, it can be recovered if you forget your password. This kind of recovery is more secure than writing down a recovery phrase.
